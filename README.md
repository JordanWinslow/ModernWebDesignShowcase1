  Jordan Winslow: Front End Web Developer Website Showcase Item 1
</h1>
<p>
  This website was designed from scratch with React, Gatsby, GraphQL and Styled-Components. It is designed mobile-first with a responsive design including responsive text utilizing "vw" and "rem" measurement units as well as flexible media queries. 
</p>
<p>
  The code was written with numerous techniques to demonstrate knowledge of imports, exports, require(), styled-components vs. master CSS file and local component css files. If the code appears "hacky" this is why!
